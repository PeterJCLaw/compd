A competition daemon for Student Robotics.

Many Scarzies died to bring us this implementation.

History
=======

This will be the fourth implementation of compd in as many years. Hopefully this one, being simpler than the others, will actually stick.

Getting Started
===============

To install:

1. Install redis, version 2.6 or later
2. Install virtualenv (via, eg, *sudo easy_install virtualenv*)
3. Run *./install*

All other dependencies, through the magic of virtualenv, are installed locally - in the *dep* directory as a matter of fact.

To run, use *./run*.

To develop, enter the virtualenv using *./shell*.

Credit
======

This implementation done through effective slave labour by Alistair Lynn.

With thanks to Rob Spanton, Scarzy, Sam Phippen, Edd Seabrook and Ben Clive for ideas and work on the previous iterations.
